# What is RealmGenerator
RealmGenerator is a wbsite you can find under http://realmgenerator.eu, check http://realmgenerator.eu/about.html for more info.

# CLI interface
You can also generate model files directly from command line. Example:
```shell
$ php processor-cli.php Android model.json 

./data/realm_model585274f772158/
```
You will get the name of the directory containing the generated files.

# How its made?
The main algorithm which does the conversion is written in PHP. 
Normally I'm an Android developer and I made this generataor becase I needed it. As I'm not an expert in PHP, there are probably many places where the code can be improved. 
I will be grateful for any feedback:).

# Plans
I'm planning to add Objectiv C and React Native too.
